I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

🎇 I am interested in adapting/developing data mining and machine learning algorithms to/on graph data (i.e., non-IID, relational, non-grid, non-Euclidean data).

🤔 The real-world graph data can be (1) **related to the temporal information** (i.e., time-evolving topological structures, time-evolving node/graph features/labels, etc.) and (2) **imperfect** (i.e., missing features, scarce labels, hard-to-interpret, redundant, privacy-leaking, robustness-lacking, etc.).

😄 Hence, my research focuses on investigating (1) **Natural Dynamics** (e.g., leveraging spatial-temporal properties of graphs) and (2) **Artificial Dynamics** (e.g., augmenting and pruning graph components) in Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks to achieve task performance upgrades in accuracy, efficiency, explanation, privacy, fairness, etc., and I am also keen on Graph Data Management and Graph Theory.
